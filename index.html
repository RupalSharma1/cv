        Healthy reader:<br>
        It helps me creating positive thoughts and at the same time increases my knowledge. <br>My most recent read was <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/" target ="_blank">Sapiens</a> by <em>Yuval Noah Harari</em>, a book talking about evolution in the past and emergence of <em>Homo sapiens</em> as the most successful species in the world.<br>
        I was recently reading about Afganisthan issue a lot and how the advancement of taliban will ultimately affect India.

        Running:<br>
        Since I was always inside in an Army environment, I always believed working on my physical health.<br>
        Hence incalcated this interesting hobby of running whenever I got time. While running I only saw the finish line and desire to reach there at the first place.<br>
        This hobby of mine incorporated discipline and teamspirit in me.
